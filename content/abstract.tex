\begin{abstract}
This report introduces how to solve the \emph{software package dependency problem} by using off-the-shelf SAT solvers. Based on experiments with \emph{Ivy} and \emph{Maven} ecosystems, the report introduces in detail how to handle important practical problems, such as report friendly error messages and choose the optimal solution.

Beyond Ivy and Maven, this report also discusses pragmatics and best practices that are general to software package dependency management. The reflections might be helpful for future ecosystem designers.
