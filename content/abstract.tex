\begin{abstract}
This report introduces how to solve the \emph{dependency management problem} in software development by using off-the-shelf SAT solvers. Based on experiments on \emph{Ivy} and \emph{Maven} ecosystems, the report introduces in detail how to handle important practical problems, such as report friendly error messages and choose the optimal solution.

Beyond Ivy and Maven, this report also discusses pragmatics and best practices that are related to software package dependency management in general. These reflections might be helpful for future ecosystem designers.
